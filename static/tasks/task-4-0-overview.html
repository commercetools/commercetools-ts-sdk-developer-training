    <p>
      Carts not only store the products a customer intends to purchase but also
      facilitates key actions like applying discounts and selecting shipping
      methods. Properly managing the cart is essential for driving sales and
      improving the customer journey. Lifestyle and Home Corp would like to
      implement that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Customers can apply discount codes to their cart.</li>
      <li>Customers can update their shipping address.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="font-weight-light">Steps</h3>
    <br />
    Perform the following programmatically, using the SDK:
    <br /><br />
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <input
          class="form-check-input me-1"
          type="checkbox"
          value=""
          aria-label="..."
        />
        Add a discount code to the cart.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <input
          class="form-check-input me-1"
          type="checkbox"
          value=""
          aria-label="..."
        />
        Update shipping address on the cart.
