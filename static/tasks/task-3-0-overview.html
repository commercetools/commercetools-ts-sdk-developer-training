    <h2 class="font-weight-light">Checkout Workflow</h2>
    <p>
      Carts in Composable Commerce serve a crucial role of binding everything
      together. The whole checkout process revolves around Carts. When
      implemented properly, carts can help with the conversion rate and thereby
      reduce the number of abandoned carts. Lifestyle and Home Corp understands
      the importance of Carts and would like to implement the following related
      to the Carts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Customer should be able to browse through products from a store.</li>
      <li>
        A new cart, if one doesn’t already exist, is transparently created when
        a customer chooses to add a product to Cart’.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="font-weight-light">Steps</h3>
    <br />
    Perform the following programmatically, using the SDK:
    <br /><br />
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <input
          class="form-check-input me-1"
          type="checkbox"
          value=""
          aria-label="..."
        />
        Get all products available in the store through Product Selections.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <input
          class="form-check-input me-1"
          type="checkbox"
          value=""
          aria-label="..."
        />
        Create an anonymous Cart for your Store and add products (LineItems) to
        the cart.
      </li>
    </ul>
